Run Linux commands in Windows using a batch file

Download the cmd (Windows batch file) script for your desired Linux command, and save it in your Windows path. 

For example, to run the "ls" command to list files and directories in Windows OS, please download "ls.cmd" file and save in C:\Windows directory and use "ls" command instead of "dir" alongwith common switches (parameters), i.e., -l and -a etc.

Download clear.cmd file to use "clear" command instead of "cls" in Windows
